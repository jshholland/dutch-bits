fpi.py is an equation solver written in Python. It uses the method of fixed
point iteration based on a user-provided script and command line parameters
to define the function to solve and various other parameters.

Hopefully the code is more or less self-documenting, check ./fpi.py --help too.

The only requirement is a working Python implementation; only core packages
are used.

TODO
- establish whether using decimal.Decimal is the right way to go
  (it's a pain to use with the math modul)
- add a load of docstrings
